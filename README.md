# DSC_correction
Set of python scripts for the correction of DSC data. 

To run the program, please copy all the needed input files into the folder rawdata. Modify the two input files 'Files.txt' and 'Input_params.txt' according to your needs. To run the program, execute Correction1.py. 

A comprehensive description of the program will be provided soon. At this version, it only normalizes the rawdata and performs a simple baseline subtraction. I am working on the data correction by the empty cell and the buffer-buffer measurements.
